// primitive vs non primitive

//primitive is a data type that can only store a single piece of data

// non primitive data type can contain multiple data

// what are variables and why are they useful?

// let assign values to a space in memory
//assign data to a placeholder
//containers for data
//named storages for data
//store data to refer back to

//let vs const
// let: value can be reassigned
let cat;

let likes = 0
console.log(likes)
likes = likes += 1
console.log(likes)


// const: value can not be reassigned

const like = 0

// best practice for variable naming
// identifier must always represent the data that is being contained.
//should not with numbers
// camelCase for two worded variabies
// reserved keys can not be used
// should not start with capital words
// should not contain any spaces

//error
// console.log(pokemon): undefind, pokemon not assigned

//
